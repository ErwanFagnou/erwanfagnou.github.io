I am currently a machine learning student, doing my last year before graduating a Master of Science, at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (MVA Master), and Télécom Paris, in France. I am passionate about many fields of artificial intelligence, and love doing projects (either for school or for fun), involving different fields of deep learning.

- reinforcement learning (either theoretical or more applied, and inverse RL)
- the maths behind deep learning (in particular, optimization and initialization)
- design of new deep learning architectures (replacing or modifying standard layers to improve a model or adapt it to a particular data structure for example; this definition is naturally rather broad, and corresponds to a more application-oriented part of deep learning)
