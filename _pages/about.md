I am currently a **PhD student in deep learning**. I am passionate about many fields of artificial intelligence, such as optimization, NLP, reinforcement learning...

My research is about **frugal ML**: I aim at making deep learning models more resource-efficient while maintaining their performance -- the term "resource" referring for instance to time, memory, money, carbon emissions, etc. The PhD focuses mainly on transformers applied to NLP, as they are by far the most resource-consuming models in the field (hello ChatGPT). This is still a very broad topic, and multiple angles of attack are considered -- from the architecture of the model to the optimization of the training process. A particular attention is given to adaptive models, i.e. models that can adapt their architecture to the task at hand dynamically, which is a promising way to make them more efficient and waste less resources.

December _2023 - today_

PhD student in the MILES team of the LAMSADE lab, at Université Dauphine - PSL, under the supervision of [Pr. Alexandre Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/). It is founded by the PEPR SHARP (Sharp Theoretical and Algorithmic Principles for frugal Machine Learning), which involves several actors collaborating towards frugal machine learning.

Title: **Adaptive and Frugal Deep Learning Architectures**
